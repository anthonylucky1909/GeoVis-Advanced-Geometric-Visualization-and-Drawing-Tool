# LiteDraw: Geometry Drawing App ‚ú®

## Overview

**GeoVis** is a lightweight **geometry drawing and visualization** tool built using **Python** and **Qt**. It lets users draw shapes, run geometric algorithms (like convex hull and line intersection), and view results interactively in a GUI or through a CLI.

## Features

### üñ•Ô∏è Graphical Interface (GUI)

- Draw and move circles, lines, and polygons
- Zoom and pan on canvas
- Step-by-step visualization of algorithms like:
  - Convex Hull (Graham Scan, QuickHull)
  - Line Intersection
  - Polygon Clipping
  - Voronoi Diagram

### ‚å®Ô∏è Command-Line Interface (CLI)

- Run geometry commands like `draw_circle`, `calculate_hull`
- Process batch commands from `input.txt`

### üíæ File Support

- Read shape and algorithm configs from `input.txt`
- Export visualizations to images (e.g., PNG, SVG)

## File Structure

- `cg_algorithms.py`: Geometry algorithms (convex hull, intersection, etc.)
- `cg_gui.py`: PyQt5 GUI application
- `cg_cli.py`: CLI for running commands
- `input.txt`: Define shapes and commands for batch processing
- `Compute-Graphic.pro`: Qt project config (for Qt Creator)
- `README.md`: This guide
- `LICENSE`: License info

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5 (Install with: `pip install PyQt5`)

## Example Input File (input.txt)

```txt
circle 100 100 50
rectangle 150 150 100 50
convex_hull 10 20 30 40 50
```

**GeoVis** is ideal for students, developers, and researchers exploring computational geometry. üöÄ
