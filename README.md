## üìñ Overview

**LiteDraw** (formerly **GeoVis**) is a lightweight application for **geometry drawing and visualization**, built with **Python** and **Qt (PyQt5)**.  

It supports both an **interactive graphical interface** and a **command-line interface (CLI)**, enabling users to draw shapes, execute geometric algorithms, and visualize results step by step.

## üöÄ Features

### Graphical Interface (GUI)
- Draw and manipulate **circles, lines, and polygons**  
- Interactive canvas with **zoom and pan**  
- Step-by-step visualization of algorithms:
  - Convex Hull (Graham Scan, QuickHull)  
  - Line Intersection  
  - Polygon Clipping  
  - Voronoi Diagram (basic)  

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Execute geometry commands directly:
  ```txt
  draw_circle 100 100 50
  convex_hull 10 20 30 40 50
  ```
- Process batch commands from `input.txt`  

### File Support
- Import shapes and algorithm configs from `input.txt`  
- Export visualizations to **PNG** or **SVG**
